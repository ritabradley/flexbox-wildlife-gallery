# Flexbox Photo Gallery

This is my interpretation of the "Life in the Wild" image gallery project from the Complete Web Developer course by [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/).

## Skills Used

-   I got a nice refresher of to use [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for centering elements on a page.
-   I also used the [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) property to add a sepia filter to all the images.
-   I add a hover transition for the images to give their original color back and slightly enlarge them.

## See it in action

I created this GIF to display how the images change color and scale.
